        The field of research on microalgae intracellular compounds has
        experienced rapid growth in recent years, primarily due to the growing
        demand for sustainable food and energy sources. Modern advances in the
        technologies used for the recovery of microalgal compounds have made it
        possible to harvest intracellular materials such as protein,
        carbohydrates, and oil with increased efficiency on an industrial scale.
        The use of these methods, alone or in combination, has also led to the
        development of various secondary products from the extracted compounds,
        such as biofuel, medicine, and cosmetics.
